# fluid-soundfont
Repo housing the original Fluid(R3)Soundfont GM (origin file cloned from [debian package](https://packages.debian.org/jessie/fluid-soundfont-gm)) and a SF3 compressed version through [sftools](https://github.com/musescore/sftools).

## Licence note
See `LICENCE` and `README` for licensing notes from the original creator. This work is in no way mine to get credit for and this repository is only made to get easier access to the SoundFont and the SoundFont that I converted to SF3.
